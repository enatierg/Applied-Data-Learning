Learning Projects in Data Analysis

This repository contains a collection of projects I completed to explore and better understand the uses of different programming and data analysis concepts.
For each project, I have added a prelude/preamble to explain its purpose and what it demonstrates, so you can understand what each does and the ideas I was experimenting with.

UAVs_expsore.py -- This project is a simple automation script for calculating premiums for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). The main goal was not to build a production-level tool, but to practice using Pythonâ€™s data analysis stack.
