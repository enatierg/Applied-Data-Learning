# UAV Premium Calculator Automation

This is a simple automation project I built to streamline premium calculations for UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles).  
The main purpose was not to create a production-level tool, but rather to practice and explore Pythonâ€™s data analysis stack.

## What it does
- Automates the repetitive task of calculating premiums for UAVs.
- Uses 'pandas' for data handling and tabular operations.
- Leverages 'numpy' for numerical computations.
- Provides a clean and reproducible workflow compared to manual spreadsheet calculations.

## Motivation
This was more of an **exercise in using pandas and numpy** than an attempt at building a complex insurance engine.  
The project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Vectorised computations
- Structuring small automation scripts
